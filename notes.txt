For query planner computations, perhaps remove top-five largest costs

    - use a delta change in cost from initial (empty index) config to present

Prompt Notes:
    tell LLM to be conservative with memory usage, only index columns that will explicitly reduce latency


Policy prompts can suggest compound indexes, index datastructures, etc.

The main reason for query bandits is that it is not necessarily the case that multiple different queries can be stuffed into a prompt.
    - bandit reward: number of recommended indexes

Ideally, index size consumption should be a parameter of the reward function
    - However, the prompts themselves can be update to tell the agent to be mindful of memory consumption.

Analyze workload to find queries that are pulling from a specific table.
    - Then, use vector distance to seed the bandit probabilities
