Based on the provided SQL query and table schema, the following columns in the `movie_info` table and related tables should be considered for indexing to optimize query performance:

1. **movie_id** - This column is frequently used in JOIN conditions and where clauses, improving lookup times for linking the `movie_info` and other related tables.
2. **info_type_id** - This column is used to filter results on the `info_type` table through joins, hence indexing can help with performance.
3. **info** - This column is accessed to find the minimum value, and while it may not cause a significant reduction in latency as frequently, having an index here can still be beneficial for aggregate functions like MIN.
4. **note** - The `note` column is used in a WHERE clause, so indexing can help in quickly filtering the records that match the specified notes.

Taking all this into account, the overall suggestion for indexing would be as follows:

```json
["movie_id", "info_type_id", "info", "note"]
```
