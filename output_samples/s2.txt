To optimize the given SQL query, we should focus on the columns that are used in the WHERE clause to filter the results, specifically those that involve conditions on the `name` table.

From the query, we can identify the relevant conditions that involve the `name` table:
- `n.gender = 'm'`
- `n.id = ci.person_id`

For optimizing performance against these conditional checks, we should create indexes on the `gender` and `id` columns of the `name` table. By indexing these columns, we can speed up the filtering and JOIN operations that involve the `name` table.

The relevant columns to index are:
1. `gender`
2. `id`

In summary, we will index the `gender` and `id` columns from the `name` table.

Here is the output in the required JSON format:

```json
["gender", "id"]
```
