Based on the provided SQL query and the `catalog_sales` table schema, the following columns should be indexed to optimize the performance of the query:

1. `cs_item_sk`: This column is used in the condition `i_item_sk = cs_item_sk`, which is critical for joining and filtering records.
2. `cs_warehouse_sk`: This column appears in the join condition `cs_warehouse_sk = w_warehouse_sk`, which is necessary for joining with the `warehouse` table.
3. `cs_sold_date_sk`: This column is involved in the condition `cs_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk` for joining with the `date_dim` table and also is used in the date range condition in the query.
4. `cs_sales_price`: This column is used in the conditions of the SUM functions to filter on the sales price.
5. `cs_order_number`: This column is used in the left join condition for matching with catalog returns.

These indexes will help reduce the latency of searching and joining operations in the supplied query.

Thus, the recommended columns to be indexed are:

```json
["cs_item_sk", "cs_warehouse_sk", "cs_sold_date_sk", "cs_sales_price", "cs_order_number"]
```
