To maximize the reward while being mindful of the storage space for the proposed index configurations, we need to analyze the provided configurations. We look for the columns that offer the highest reward relative to their storage size, aiming for a balance that ensures efficient usage of storage while enhancing performance.

Let's break down the configurations:

1. **Configuration 1** includes:
   - Reward: 17.39
   - Storage: 1430.5 MB

2. **Configuration 2** includes:
   - Reward: 4.12
   - Storage: 2027.05 MB

3. **Configuration 3** includes:
   - Reward: 6.62
   - Storage: 2073.05 MB

### Evaluation of Each Configuration:

- **Configuration 1** has the highest reward with a reasonable storage size.
- **Configuration 2** has a low reward and a high storage size, leading to poor cost-efficiency.
- **Configuration 3** has a moderate reward but a very high storage size, also leading to poor cost-efficiency.

### Identifying Columns for Indexing:

Columns from **Configuration 1** offer the best balance of reward to storage size. We will examine if any columns from Configurations 2 and 3 can be included without significantly increasing the overall storage.

**Columns from Configuration 1:**
- nation.n_nationkey
- nation.n_name
- nation.n_regionkey
- part.p_partkey
- part.p_name
- supplier.s_suppkey
- partsupp.ps_partkey
- partsupp.ps_suppkey
- partsupp.ps_supplycost
- customer.c_custkey
- customer.c_nationkey
- customer.c_acctbal
- customer.c_phone
- orders.o_orderkey
- orders.o_custkey
- orders.o_totalprice
- orders.o_orderdate
- lineitem.l_shipdate
- lineitem.l_returnflag
- lineitem.l_linestatus

**Columns from Configuration 2 that are not in Configuration 1:**
- part.p_brand
- part.p_type
- part.p_size
- orders.o_orderpriority
- lineitem.l_orderkey
- lineitem.l_shipmode
- lineitem.l_commitdate
- lineitem.l_receiptdate

**Columns from Configuration 3 that are not in Configuration 1:**
- region.r_name
- supplier.s_nationkey
- supplier.s_name

### Conclusion:

After evaluating the configurations, we see that we should focus on retaining columns from Configuration 1 for indexing since they yield the highest reward without excessive storage demand. 

Columns from Configurations 2 and 3 do not significantly enhance the reward given their high storage size, so they can be omitted or marked as not suitable for indexing.

The final output will be structured as follows:
